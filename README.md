# Common Algorithms - Scala

This repository contains common concepts and algorithms used in code interviews

The purpose of this is to provide an extensive and descriptive approach for others to use when learning these topics

Each implementation will be fully commented to detail what is happening at each stage of processing

The table below is a reflection of what is currently implemented in this repository
